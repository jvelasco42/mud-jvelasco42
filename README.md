A multi-user dungeon (MUD) is both a style of role-playing game and the name of one
of the original text-based multiplayer online role-playing games of this genre. 

This MUD uses networking to allow multiple users to interact with each other while
exploring the halls of the Computer Science department at Trinity University.
